# The Secret Society

***La Liga Arcana*** is a *secret society of magic-touched individuals* in modern Manila, dedicated to preserving the city’s hidden magical pulse—the ***Diwa Encantada***. Operating in *plain sight but unseen,* the Liga intervenes only when magical phenomena threaten to spill into the mundane world, relying on careful research, ritual, and the Habi, an ethereal weave that cloaks arcane activity from ordinary citizens.

The Liga was founded at the tail end of the Spanish Revolution by revered wizards *Serafina Solis* and *Mercedes Guinto*, with the financial backing of the charitable Agoncillo family, chiefly *Doña Marcela Agoncillo*, who was said to have channeled the Diwa to imbue the first Philippine flag with enchantment. Together, they created the first known ***Habi ng Diwa Encantada, or Habi***, an abjurative magic designed to protect the city’s magical elements and safeguard mundane reality. The Liga took its name from an earlier secret society, which the founders had only encountered a few times before it disbanded. A few surviving letters to Dr. Jose Rizal, himself a practitioner of bardic magic, remain preserved at the Liga’s home base in Escolta.

The Diwa Encantada is believed to *emanate from the spirit of the land itself*. Its strength was amplified during the pre-colonial era, when pagan practices and attunement to the land allowed people to channel magic naturally. During the colonial period, however, the practice of such magic was largely suppressed, and much of its knowledge nearly lost.

Throughout history, members of La Liga Arcana are *wizards and magical specialists*, often drawn from elite or educated backgrounds, and bound by a strict code of discipline, secrecy, and hierarchy. Unlike classic “heroic orders,” the Liga is *reactive and investigative*: they track supernatural disturbances tied to Manila’s mundane life, steward the Diwa, and ensure the city’s magical currents continue to flow undisturbed.

## The Liga Today
---

The modern La Liga Arcana is a loose but dedicated collective of wizards and magical specialists who now come from *every imaginable background*. Early exclusivity has long dissolved; today’s members include barangay health workers, baristas, lawyers, FX drivers, public school teachers, programmers, artists, cargadores, accountants, and anyone the Diwa seems willing to resonate with. What binds them is not prestige but ***attunement***—some spark or calling that the Habi “notices.”

Their guiding code emphasizes *care, stewardship, and responsibility* over hierarchy. Academic study of magic remains important—absolutely in the top five priorities—but it supports rather than defines their ethos. The Liga views magic as *something borrowed from the city*, not owned by its practitioners. Their work involves tending to the Habi, soothing spiritual imbalances, and preventing arcane disturbances from bleeding into everyday Manila life.

The society is currently led by ***Dr. Ed Paglinawan***, a practicing physician whose bedside manner extends naturally into arcane stewardship. His counterpart in magical doctrine is the Grand Archmage ***Cecilia Abad***, who advises the Liga with a mixture of scholarship, lived experience, and an unnerving ability to sense when the weave is about to ripple.

Together, they guide a Manila-sized family of practitioners who keep the city’s secret magic beating quietly beneath the noise, heat, and neon.
