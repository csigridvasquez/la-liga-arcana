# La Liga Arcana

La Liga Arcana is a *secret society of magic-touched individuals* in modern Manila, dedicated to preserving the city’s hidden magical pulse—the ***Diwa Encantada***. Operating in *plain sight but unseen,* the Liga intervenes only when magical phenomena threaten to spill into the mundane world, relying on careful research, ritual, and the Habi, an ethereal weave that cloaks arcane activity from ordinary citizens.

The Liga was founded at the tail end of the Spanish Revolution by revered wizards *Serafina Solis* and *Mercedes Guinto*, with the financial backing of the charitable Agoncillo family, chiefly *Doña Marcela Agoncillo*, who was said to have channeled the Diwa to imbue the first Philippine flag with enchantment. Together, they created the first known ***Habi ng Diwa Encantada, or Habi***, an abjurative magic designed to protect the city’s magical elements and safeguard mundane reality. The Liga took its name from an earlier secret society, which the founders had only encountered a few times before it disbanded. A few surviving letters to Dr. Jose Rizal, himself a practitioner of bardic magic, remain preserved at the Liga’s home base in Escolta.

The Diwa Encantada is believed to *emanate from the spirit of the land itself*. Its strength was amplified during the pre-colonial era, when pagan practices and attunement to the land allowed people to channel magic naturally. During the colonial period, however, the practice of such magic was largely suppressed, and much of its knowledge nearly lost.

Members of La Liga Arcana are *wizards and magical specialists*, often drawn from elite or educated backgrounds, and bound by a strict code of discipline, secrecy, and hierarchy. Unlike classic “heroic orders,” the Liga is *reactive and investigative*: they track supernatural disturbances tied to Manila’s mundane life, steward the Diwa, and ensure the city’s magical currents continue to flow undisturbed.
